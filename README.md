# Digit-Recognition

Three Jupyter notebooks I used to research several topics in machine learning
and data science. They are unorganized and were mostly used to compile 
results for other work. A presentation power point file is included for
one of the projects in digit recognition. Fish Detection was a classification 
problem I was researching. Mostly visualization techniques were explored but I 
did run some tests with an SVM implementation. Finally, some basic neural 
networks were tested with Pytorch to better understand how Pytorch works.
